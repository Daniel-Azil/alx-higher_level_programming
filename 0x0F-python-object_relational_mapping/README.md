# 0x0F Python Object-Relational Mapping

This project explores Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) in Python, focusing on the use of MySQLDB and SQLAlchemy.

## File Implementations

- **0-select_states.py:** The primary script that connects to a MySQL database and fetches all states from the `states` table.
- **1-filter_states.py:** A script that lists all states with a name starting 
with N (upper N) from the database `hbtn_0e_0_usa`.
- **2-my_filter_states.py:** script that takes in an argument and displays all values in the states table of hbtn_0e_0_usa where name matches the argument.
